# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program


## Choice of Final PID Parameters and Explanation
At first only the proportional parameter was used. It was set to a value of 0.05 which was just enough steering to bring the vehicle close to the center line at low speeds. With the proportional control alone, however, the vehicle encountered high amplitude oscillations at higher longitudinal speeds.
The derivative term was introduced to mitigate the oscillatory behavior. It was set to 0.25. This immediately got rid of the oscillatory behavior at higher speeds. At this point the vehicle behaves properly with the exception of the first turn after the bridge, where the turn is too sharp. The rise time of the current controller is too long and hence the car drives off the track.
As a first attempt, the integral term was introduced to try to "accumulate" the lagging error over time, so that the car doesn't drive off the tracks. However, as it turned out, any value for the integral term significantly close enough to the proportional term's value interferes with the proportional controller. This is seen as the vehicle over-steers from the start. As a result, the integral term was reduced to a magnitude 3 orders below that of the proportional term meaning that its effect is comparable to the effect of the proportional term after accumulating the same bias over 1000 iterations.
Still, to fix the slow rise time issue, the proportional and derivative term were uniformly increased by a factor of two to the values P = .1 and D = .5.
This yielded a smooth and fast behavior throughout the track.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`.

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
